To install Clang on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. Download LLVM pre-built binaries: Visit the LLVM download page (https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) and download the latest pre-built binary for Windows.

2. Run the installer: Execute the downloaded installer file and follow the installation steps. Make sure to add LLVM to your system's PATH during the installation process when prompted. This will allow you to use Clang from the command prompt.

3. Verify the installation: Open a new command prompt and enter the following command:

```
clang --version
```

If Clang is installed correctly, you should see the version information.

4. Compile a C program using Clang: Save your C code to a file, e.g., `hello_world.c`. In the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the C file and enter the following command to compile the C program:

```
clang hello_world.c -o hello_world.exe
```

This command will compile the `hello_world.c` file and create an executable file named `hello_world.exe`.

5. Run the compiled C program: Enter the following command in the command prompt to run the compiled program:

```
hello_world.exe
```

This command will execute the `hello_world.exe` file, and you should see the output of your C program.
